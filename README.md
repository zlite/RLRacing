This is a simplified Reinforcement Learning environment for a self-driving racecar. Right now it just lets you drive around the track with the arrow keys and shows the positing and heading, resetting if you go off the track. 

*ToDo: add the DQN learning part

*ToDo: add randomly generated tracks and determine if we are on the track for any shape track

*ToDo: integrate with DonkeyCar so it uses GPS position rather than simulation coordinates

*ToDo: record a track in the real world with GPS positions
